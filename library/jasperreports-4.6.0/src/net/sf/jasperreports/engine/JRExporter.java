/**
 * All document exporting in JasperReports is done through this interface. There is an implementation of
 * this interface for every document format that JasperReports supports at the moment.
 * <p>
 * Export customization is realized by using export parameters. Each exporter is able to recognize and use
 * its own parameters, but there is a subset of predefined parameters that are common to all exporters.
 * Those are identified by constants in the {@link JRExporterParameter} base class. All parameters are documented
 * inside the classes where they are defined.
 * <p>
 * An important aspect is the output type of each exporter. There are three types of exporters depending on
 * the type of output they produce:
 * <ul>
 * <li>exporters that export to text or character based file formats (HTML, RTF, CSV, TXT, XML exporters);
 * <li>exporters that export to binary file formats (PDF and XLS exporters)
 * <li>exporters that export directly to graphic devices (Graphics2D and Java Print Service exporters)
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * All existing exporters fall into two categories depending on the way the content of the documents they
 * produce could be structured:
 * <ul>
 * <li> there are the exporters which target document formats which support free-form page content. These
 * are the Grapchis2D, PDF, RTF and XML exporters.
 * <li> the second category of exporters groups those exporters that target document formats which only
 * support relative positioning of elements on a page or a grid-based layout. In this category we have the
 * HTML, XLS and CSV exporters.
 * </ul>
