JasperReports Library Change Log
===================================

JasperReports 4.6.0 (2012-05-21, SVN 5400)
---------------------------------------------

- improved JasperReports configuration infrastructure by the introduction of a JasperReportsContext, 
an new interface from where JR configuration properties are read and JR extensions are loaded.
This allows different configurations of the JR engine to exist simultaneously in the same JVM;

- improved JasperReports Web Framework which now features a centralized controller to dispatch
actions triggered by end user interactions in the report viewer. Actions are backed by atomized 
commands that modify the report metadata on-the-fly, with support for undo/redo operations, 
to reflect changes in the report output;

- introduction of reusable Web report viewer APIs, featuring configurable report viewing servlets,
and built-in Javascript modules that can be used to create custom interactive report viewers in Web
applications embedding the JasperReports Library.
This is demonstrated in the new /demo/samples/webapp-repo sample where two different looking versions
of the same build-in JR interactive report viewer are used to displays interactive reports;

- enhanced interactivity in the table component, with support for column formatting, hiding, resizing,
moving, sorting and filtering, all leveraging the new action-based JR Web Framework controller and its 
interactivity supporting report viewer Javascript APIs;

- introduction of a data caching API that helps avoid re-querying the report's data source, 
for performance reasons, while interactively viewing the report using an interactive report viewer
created based on the new JR Web Framework;

- added new page related events in the asynchronous report filler to support asynchronous page display
in interactive report viewers;

- added support for message providers that can be plugged into JR as extensions, to allow 
internationalization of interactive custom components UIs;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.5.1 (2012-03-05, SVN 5027)
---------------------------------------------

- the JSON data source and the respective JSON query executer were moved 
from the samples folder to the core library;

- support for macros added in XLS and XSLX exporters;

- the repository APIs were enhanced with support for pluggable persistence 
services to load and store resources in the repository;

- the "net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.force.linebreak.policy" configuration 
property is un-deprecated, as a partial revert of the changes made in 4.1.1 with 
regards to PDF text rendering; These changes were partially reverted as they affected 
the performance of the PDF exporter when dealing with simple texts. The AWT-based text 
rendering is now performed only on complex text fields that contain tab characters 
for tab stop alignment or contain multiple paragraphs, with variable paragraph styling.

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.5.0 (2011-12-06, SVN 4839)
---------------------------------------------

- border and padding style properties added to crosstab elements;

- optimized text measurement for short and simple texts, to speed up report filling process;

- new "net.sf.jasperreports.export.xls.use.timezone" export configuration property added
to force translation of date values during XLS export, to the timezone used to fill the report;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.1.3 (2011-10-28, SVN 4774)
---------------------------------------------

- new XLS/XLSX export configuration properties added for advanced features 
including auto-filter, row outline collapse/expand grouping and custom column width; 

- enhanced support for interactive sorting and filtering, with more filter criteria 
available depending on column data type and possibility to sort and filter on multiple
columns at the same time; 

- improved virtualization by consolidating styling information for repeating subreports
and by splitting large pages into smaller virtualized pieces for non-paginated reports;

- the XML exporter was changed to use namespaces and thus allow pluggable generic element 
parameter value handlers; 

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.1.2 (2011-09-12, SVN 4600)
---------------------------------------------
- support for PDF/A compliance added to the PDF exporter;

- new sort/filter custom component added to allow non-table component reports to leverage 
the interactive sorting and filtering feature when deployed inside the JR Web Framework; 

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.1.1 (2011-08-11, SVN 4550)
---------------------------------------------
- deprecated code for JRReportFont, JRBox, graphic element pen property
and all deprecated byte-based properties were removed from the library's API;

- the whole JR source code was overhauled to make use of Java5-style Generics;

- value class property is now deprecated in expression objects; the type of
expression no longer needs to be specified;

- the library's API was extended with a new repository API, which is used now
throughout the reporting engine to locate report resources such as images, fonts, 
subreports, etc; 

- new parameter contributor interface was added to the engine to allow parameter
manipulation prior to query execution; parameter contributors can be plugged in as
extensions;

- new data adapter concept was added to the library's API to allow the reporting engine
to connect to data directly, without the parent application providing the data the source 
nor the query executer parameters, at report fill time;

- new report executing servlet was added as part of a larger Web framework that
is now available in the library's core API, to simplify deployment of JR inside
Web applications and achieve higher degree of interactivity for reports;
details about how this new Web framework can be used can be seen in the new
/demo/samples/webapp-repo sample, which also makes use of the newly introduced
repository API, to locate the report templates and their additional resources;

- the table component was enhanced so that it is more interactive by default,
when the reports are deployed in an application that makes use of the above mentioned
Web framework; by default, table columns are sortable, while text columns are filtrable
using a simple "contains" filter criteria; this can be seen in the TableReport
deployed in the /demo/samples/webapp-repo sample;

- new map component added to the core library to simplify rendering of Google maps
inside reports;

- new XLS metadata exporter added, similar to the CSV metadata exporter in which
columns that need to be exported have to be marked-up using configuration properties 
at text element level;

- new XLSX data source and query executer added; details about how it works 
are found in the new /demo/samples/xlsxdatasource sample;

- pattern expression added to text fields elements to allow for more flexible
dates and numbers formatting;

- custom property "net.sf.jasperreports.export.xls.pattern" is now available to control
cell formatting patterns in XLS/XLSX exporters;

- new custom properties are available in XLS/XLSX exporters to freeze panes;

- new "net.sf.jasperreports.image.dpi" custom property added to allow specifying 
the image resolution in dots-per-inch, for the images created by the engine when 
rasterizing SVGs or when clipping other image renderers;

- the "net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.force.linebreak.policy" configuration property
is now deprecated as the PDF text rendering code was refactored so that text is rendered 
exactly like in AWT;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;
