%% Portions of this product were developed using ANTLR.  ANTLR 1989-2000 
developed by jGuru.com, http://www.ANTLR.org and http://www.jGuru.com.


ANTLR 1989-2000 Developed by jGuru.com (MageLang Institute), 
http://www.ANTLR.org  and http://www.jGuru.com

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
incorporate any source code into one of your programs
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
system and expect to make other tools available as they are
completed.


This product includes Perl.  Please refer to the following site for 
more information on how you can get that source code if available:
